Tasks I had to write as a part of the Concurrent Programming class. 

The transaction_manager project is written in Java 8 and manages performing transactions for many threads.

The actors_system project is written in C11 and involves using a thread pool to simulate the actors system and has two examples of usage.

The multithreaded_page_rank project is written in C++14 and compares running times of single threaded version of the Page Rank algorithm with a multithreded one's.
