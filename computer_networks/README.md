# Computer networks
1. Http Server - simplified http server with correlated servers (if a resource is not found, 
the server can return MOVED code to inform that the resource can be found in other place)
2. Screen worms - server for playing a multiplayer game (clone of Netacka/Achtung, die Kurve!)
3. DataVac - project of a network for a fictional company (polish only)
